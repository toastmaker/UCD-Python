Write only what you need now.\n  - Identify emerging patterns and continuously adapt the structure of your code (refactoring).\n  - Resist the urge to over-engineer! Overengineering and unstructured code both violate this.\n  - Start simple (with something that works), and then improve it - __refactoring__.\n  - Simple is better than complex, Complex is better than complicated\n  - Often need to try out different ideas quickly: rapid prototyping of a proposed algorithm re-use/modify existing code\n\n- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) - code duplication equals bug reuse\n    - avoid duplication: Copy-and-paste a snippet, instead of refactoring it into a function\n    - use modules\n    - Special cases aren\u2019t special enough to break the rules\n    - What happens if the original code contains a bug?\n    - What happens if the original code needs to be changed?\n    - **Invest time now to save time later!** (especially when facing oh so important deadlines)\n\n- Readability\n\n- Zen of Python: *Explicit is better then implicit, Beautiful is better than ugly*\n\n- Use exceptions\n\n- Identify emerging patterns and continuously adapt the structure of your code\n    - *Design Patterns.
