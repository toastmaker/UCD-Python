Level of explanations (difficulty to follow the speaker):\n    \n    - 0 = I didn't get anything from what that guy was talking about\n    - 10= more Feynman-like teachers like him!\n    \n3. I find such a course useful in general:\n    \n    - 0 = total bullshit\n    - 10= how could I have lived without it?\n\n4. I find it useful in my particular field of research:\n    \n    - 0 = bullshit\n    - 10= how could I have lived without it?\n\n5. Did the course meet your expectation?\n\n    - 0 = worse than my worst nightmare\n    - 10= beyond all my wishes\n    \n6. Would you recommend it to a friend?\n\n    - 0 = better to keep away\n    - 10= absolutely!\n\n7. How much of the discussed topics were new to you?\n\n    - 0 = never heard about anything like this before\n    - 10= I knew everything already from before, waste of time\n    \n8. How much new did you hear/learn from the course?\n\n    - 0 = zero\n    - 10= I think I could use it now with ease and confidence \n\n9. Topics covered however you would find yourself happy rather not to be covered:\n    \n    - ?\n    \n10. Topics not covered but those you would like to learn about if you could:\n    \n    - ?\n\n11. Further comments?\n\n    - ?"
